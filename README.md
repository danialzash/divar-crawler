# divar-crawler

I have created a Python code to crawl through the houses listed on the Divar website.

- This is a basic tool for obtaining the name of a region and discovering the prices of houses located within that region.- by now details of the houses - The information can be saved in a basic text file or the default database.
- You can obtain information about all the houses listed on the website without specifying a particular region.
